# Tiamov3-Firmware
Firmware files so that the pcb for the Kalam Tiamo v3 can be used on VIA.

This is on my github for ease of archival and availability.

To use the firmware files, first flash the hex file to the pcb using qmk toolbox(the pcb is 32u4 based), then open VIA or VIAL and upload the JSON file from the design tab or from the "file button" dropdown to access the keymap of the pcb. from there you'll beable to configure the pcb layot to your hearts content.
